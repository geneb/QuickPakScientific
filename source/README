            Additions to the QuickPak Scientific Owner's Manual


Included with QuickPak Scientific is a complete BASIC implementation of a
Hewlett-Packard programmable hand-held calculator.  We have provided both
the executable version as well as the full QuickBASIC source code.  However,
recompiling the program requires our QuickPak Professional library.  The
instruction manual for the calculator is available on-line while the program
is running.

To start the program enter HANDHELD and press Enter.  Be sure to choose an
illegal operation when you run it, to see the program author's sense of
humor.  (After starting the program and entering the calculator portion, try
pressing F1.)  Please understand that HANDHELD has no relation to QuickPak
Scientific, and it is included for your interest and amusement only.

The following files comprise the HANDHELD program:

    HANDHELD.BAS        the BASIC source code
    HANDHELD.EXE        the executable version of the program
    HHHELP.TXT          the manual on disk
    HHELPTXT.BAS        the program that creates the help text
    USRFNCT.CRD         the file that holds your user-definable functions





                         Non-Linear Curve Fitting

    The program DEMONLF1.BAS interactivly uses a combination of
unconstrained minimization and least squares to curve fit data to any
non-linear equation defined by the user.  Please see the manual addendum
for complete documentation.

The following files are used by DEMONLF1:

    DEMONLF1.MAK        the QuickBASIC make file
    DEMONLF1.BAS        the BASIC source code
    MINIMIZ3.BAS        minimization subroutine
    USRFUN1.BAS         objective function and gradient subroutine
    KEYCHECK.BAS        standard support subroutine
