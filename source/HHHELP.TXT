Calculator button selection may     be made by either placing the mouse cursor on the desired function and          clicking the left mouse button, or from the keyboard by depressing the key      printed in red at the bottom of the button.  Some buttons do not have a         red label if the keyboard has an equivalent key (numbers and simple             arithmetic functions).  Rapid input of numbers and arithmetic functions         maybe made by exclusive use of the numeric key pad on the keyboard.                                                                                                                                                                             [2]   Edit User Defined Functions                                                                                                                               This selection allows the user to define the ten function keys.                 Each function key maybe programmed to conduct a complex calculation which       may include simple constants, current calculator X Y Z or Memory values,        parentheses, and or reserved calculator functions.                              Two lines of input are required for each function key.  The first line          contains text only: five characters for a button label followed by prompt       text.  This prompt text appears in the lower left corner of the main menu       screen and at the bottom of the calculator screen. This feature maybe invoked   by loading X with the function key number and selecting the ViewF key.          The second line of input contains the actual 'equation' assigned to the         function key.  The syntax of this line follows simple BASIC rules, such as      the caret symbol (^) for exponentiation.  No syntax checking is conducted       until the function key is depressed . . .Double check your input and run        several test cases after an edit session.

Pan the manual with       [PgUp] [PgDn] [Home] [End] [Cursor Up or Dn].  Larger text maybe displayed      by depressing [L]arge.

Instructions for    this module are displayed in the lower left corner of the screen.

A confirmation of quit / exit      is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The mouse driver routines where written assuming that the mouse sensitivity     parameter is set to the maximum.  For Mouse Systems equipment depress and hold  <Ctrl> and <Alt> while clicking the left mouse button.  The system should       beep once, depress 9, the system should beep twice.  For Logitech equipment     the keys <Ctrl> and <Alt> are depressed while the right mouse button is         clicked until the tone reaches the highest pitch.

Note the absence of an equal key.                                               Three stack positions and a memory register are provided.                       The stack positions are labeled X Y Z with the memory labeled M.                                                                                                The primary arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,     and division operate on the X and Y stack positions.                            The result of the opertion is located in the Y stack position.

Example:                X       Operation      Result in X                                                                                                                             25           ûx              5                                                                                                           Selection of key strokes may be made by use of a mouse, if installed,           or by the standard keyboard.                                                    To select a key under mouse control, place the point of the mouse cursor        onto the desired key and depress a mouse button.                                The key will be selected upon button release.  For keyboard key selection       depress the keyboard key assigned to the specific calculator key.               The lower symbol on each calculator key indicates the appropriate               keyboard key to depress.

To change the definition of either the key labelling or the functional    equation select the Edit User Defined Functions option from the Main Menu.      Each function key requires two lines of information.  The first line contains   the key label (up to 5 characters), while the second line contains the actual   function key equation.  Allowed syntax of the functions is shown below.         With the exception of the natural logarithm base e, all entries should be       made in upper case.  The equation should be typed as the right hand side of a   line of code.  Trigonometric funtions will be conducted in the same set of      units as the DRG Mode indicates (Degrees, Radians, Gradients).
